    "The project aimed to assist investors in understanding stock trends by analyzing time-series data of ASML’s stock performance. As a third-party consulting firm, we specialize in helping investors and companies gain insights into market behavior, enabling them to make informed decisions based on data-driven forecasts. For this project, we sourced daily stock price data from Yahoo Finance, covering ASML stock prices from January 1, 2018, to November 15, 2024. The daily data was aggregated into weekly averages, resulting in a weekly time-series dataset containing cxx records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business objective was to predict the future trend of ASML’s stock prices for a 2-week horizon, as this information is crucial for investors looking to optimize their portfolio strategies. The dataset was split into training and testing sets based on the variable test_weeks, which included the last 12 weeks of data for testing, while the rest was used for training. Preprocessing techniques such as normalization, handling missing values, and data smoothing were applied to prepare the data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested multiple forecasting models, including SARIMAX, Prophet, XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive, and ETS (additive and multiplicative). Prophet was selected as the final model based on its superior performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). After optimization, the model achieved a MAPE of 3XX% on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model was deployed to provide reliable forecasts for the next two weeks, offering valuable insights to investors aiming to anticipate stock trends and make strategic decisions."
